naked react template for dirty prototyping

this is exactly like a vite + react project, but without styling, typescript and assets.

to run locally:

- clone it with `git clone https://github.com/LukeberryPi/naked-react.git`
- install the dependencies with `npm i`
- then run `npm run dev`

now `localhost:5173` is ready for some dirty prototyping!
